## Financial Model Details

### NPV Calculation
- 20-year projection period
- 10% discount rate (configurable)
- Includes operational cash flows and financing costs
- Accounts for vessel depreciation and scrap value

### IRR Calculation
- Newton-Raphson iterative method
- Handles complex cash flow patterns
- Converges with 0.0001 tolerance
- Maximum 1000 iterations for stability

### Cash Flow Components
- **Revenue**: Daily charter rate √ó utilization √ó days
- **Operating Expenses**: Daily OpEx √ó 365 days
- **Financing Costs**: Loan principal and interest payments
- **Capital Expenditures**: Purchase price and major repairs
- **Residual Value**: Scrap value at end of analysis period

## AI Integration
